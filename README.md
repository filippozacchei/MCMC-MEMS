# MCMC-MEMS
Library for parameter identification in MEMS accelerometer devices thorugh computational bayesian approach.

The project covers the following major topics:
- Mechanics of Micro Systems, for the development of high fidelity benchmarks;
- Reduced Order Modelling, for the creation of a real time digital twin of a MEMS device; 
- Computational Statistics, to make data-driven prediction thanks to the digital twin.
